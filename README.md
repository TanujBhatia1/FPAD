# FPAD
Fingerprint Presentation Attack Detection (FPAD) based project by using KAN CNN (Kologomorov-Arnold Networks). This model is feasible for complex scientific calculations. I have used CNN based KAN for spoofness detection system to detect whether the fingerprint is real or fake. KAN divide problem into subfunctional units having different layers as I have used CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). Each layer is independent of the other one making it more reliable for fingerprint spoof detection by analysing ridges and patterns more.

The give model has been taken from the below link:
